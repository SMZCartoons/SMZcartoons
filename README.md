## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Rising Senior at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) and am Majoring in Computer Science, with a concentration in Computer Graphics/Vision!

I am very interested in Back-End and Front-End Software and Application Development, Cloud Development, and Computer Vision/Graphics.

I am currently interning as an AI Software Engineer at The Cigna Group, where I am working on integrating AI-powered features into the back-end of various applications using python, REST APIs, and AWS.

I am also working for the Center of Modeling, Simulation, and Imaging in Medicine as an Undergraduate Researcher, where I am using Pytorch and Teras to analyze videos of trial medical procedures and determine if they are being performed correctly.
